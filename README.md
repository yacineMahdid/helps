# help
Repo for sharing code with people I'm helping out online.

It's mainly separated into topics that seems to bundle well together.

## ImageJ üî¨
_ImageJ is a Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation._

The community is nice and people are working on very cool project. Helping them out is very pleasant!

## Kolmogorov Complexity ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
_In algorithmic information theory (a subfield of computer science and mathematics), the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output._

I keep receiving questions about Kolmogorov complexity and it's application to life science analysis. Working on this isn't too difficult and I already have materials to help people out.
