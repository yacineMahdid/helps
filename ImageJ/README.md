_ImageJ is a Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation._

## ImageJ Z-stack Batch Processing
The problem I was helping with was to solve the following two requirements:
1. Generate 3 Max-Intensity Z-Stack ([0-5],[6-10] and [11-15]), merge the red and green file then save as RGB.
2. Also, allow for batch processing of many files.

I had sample files and you can follow the whole process of setting this batch script up in [Fiji in this youtube video over here ðŸ“º](https://youtu.be/1jWBQqCpky8)
