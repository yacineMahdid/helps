# Kolmogorov Complexity ❓❓❓
_In algorithmic information theory (a subfield of computer science and mathematics), the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output._

## Kolmogorov Complexity to Compress DNA Sequences Using Python ?
The goal of this help was to use a DNA sequence as an input and then to generate complexity metrics. Throughout the analysis explanation was given as to how to effectively use the Kolmogorov Complexity.

Added Shannon Entropy so that we can reproduce the paper (in the github), I'm missing only statistical complexity!
